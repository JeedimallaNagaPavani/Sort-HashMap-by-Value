# Sort HashMap by Value 

Summary of the Description
What the Project Does:

It takes a HashMap (JavaScript Object) and sorts it by its values in ascending order.
Displays both the original and sorted HashMap on the webpage.


How the Code is Structured:
index.html → Contains the UI elements (buttons and text display areas).
styles.css → Adds styling for better UI presentation.
script.js → Handles sorting logic using JavaScript.

How Sorting Works in JavaScript:
Converts the HashMap (object) into an array of key-value pairs.
Uses .sort() to sort the array by values.
Converts it back into an object and updates the webpage.

How to Use the Project:
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click the "Sort HashMap" button to see the sorted result.
